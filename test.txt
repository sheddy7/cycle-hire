Senior Software Engineer - Technical Test

Your task is to write a web application that pulls data from the following open api for bike hire in London: http://cyclehire.eu/cycleHire.json

This web application should consist of two parts:
Server side part that talks to the API, written in NodeJs.
Client side part that communicates with the server and displays the data (entirely up to you how), written in ReactJS.

This is designed to be a fairly open ended task, so feel free to add additional features, frameworks and/or technologies as you see fit, but key things we will be looking for are:
Well structured, modular code.
Unit tests covering the code you write.
Defensively written code for handling potential error states (such as the API not being available).

At the end of the test, you must:
Provide source code (via a shared link to a public github or bitbucket repo) before 23:59:59 Friday 10th March 2017.
Include a README file in the root of your project that walks a user through installing and running the app.

Part of your face to face interview will then consist of talking through how you met the goals of the task, any extra features/tech you added and discussing key parts of the code.
